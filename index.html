            <h2>Working Title</h2>

            <div>
                <p>"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds. Our enemy is not
                    merely spiritual. Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our
                    windpipes are of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not amenable to mere
                    strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold
                    him; but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
                    touch. Keep this near your heart"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to
                    me, I being nearest to him--"put these flowers round your neck"--here he handed to me a wreath of
                    withered garlic blossoms--"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife; and for aid
                    in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above
                    all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless." This was a portion of Sacred Wafer,
                    which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others was similarly equipped. "Now," he
                    said, "friend John, where are the skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break
                    house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's."</p>

                <p>Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good
                    stead. Presently he got one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and,
                    with a rusty clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly
                    opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of
                    Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord
                    they shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.</p>

                <p>"In manus tuas, Domine!" he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold. We closed the
                    door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the
                    road. The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within
                    should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search.</p>

                <p>The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the
                    opacity of our bodies threw great shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that
                    there was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to
                    me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was
                    common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and
                    every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.</p>

                <p>The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were
                    recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was
                    cracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider's webs,
                    whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them
                    partly down. On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each.
                    They had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of
                    dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them. He turned to me and said:--</p>
