                <p>Hello readers, my name is Collie Clarke. At the time of writing this I’m a 23-year-old student doing
                    a certificate course at Raritan Valley Community College located in North Branch, New Jersey. I am
                    currently living in Plainfield new jersey with my grandparents and aunty. I was originally born and
                    raised in Jamaica but in 2020 I got the opportunity to move to the states and further my studies. I
                    have always had a knack for building or creating different things. As a kid my favorite toys to play
                    with were Lego’s I loved spending my time creating different vehicles. When I was in high school, I
                    did technical drawing and construction classes. Now that I’m in college I am doing a web development
                    course</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>For my hobbies there are a few activities I like to do in my spare time. One activity I like to
                        do is play video games of all sorts. These include console games on the play station (ps3) and
                        the Nintendo Wii console to games on my PC and even my phone.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Another activity I like to do is to watch a variety of different videos or content. Now these
                        videos can range from videos on YouTube to streams on twitch and sometimes some short videos on
                        TikTok.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The final activity that I will mention in this paragraph is doing absolutely nothing. This means
                        that I enjoy the activity of just being able to lay down and relax without a care in the world
                        and not have to worry about anything.</li>

            <h2>My Blog</h2>

            <div>
                <h3>Embedding maps and videos.</h3>
                <p>Have you ever wondered how some websites are able to play videos from YouTube or other streaming
                    platforms from the webpage itself. Or how you can have a section with a google maps with all its
                    features still functioning. The answer to this is pretty simple, it’s thanks to the use of embedded
                    code that web pages are to add different type of media. An embedded code is a block of HTML that is
                    placed in another page and renders a visual element a video, social media post, form, or page from
                    another website or source. You can embed YouTube videos, Twitter posts, GIFs, and other multimedia
                    objects on another website.</p>

                <h3>What is embed.</h3>
                <p>Now you might be asking what is embed exactly. Well, embed in html means to integrate external
                    content into another website or page. You embed something when you place a block of code called an
                    embed code into the HTML editor of another website. When you hit ‘Save’ or ‘Publish,’ the media then
                    renders on the published page.</p>

                <h3>How to Add HTML Embed Code.</h3>
                <p>Now when it comes to adding an HTML embed code, for each site the method of getting an html code will
                    be slightly different depending on the site. In general, you would go to the social post or webpage
                    you’d like to embed, generate the embed code using the post’s options this can either be the three
                    dots or the share button. Next you will need to find and copy the html code then paste the HTML
                    snippet you just copied into your HTML viewer window. Don’t forget to save it and with that you are
                    now finished and successfully embedded content onto your website or blog.</p>

                <h3>What is iframe.</h3>
                <p>Now when you’re embedding a video or the map you will notice that it’s in the iframe element but just
                    what is an iframe. An iframe or an inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML
                    page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page. They are
                    commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content. The iframe
                    element is easy to use, well supported and allows the embedding of third-party content. However, it
                    is a heavy processer and memory, you have no control of the third-party site and it’s difficult to
                    use in responsive design pages.</p>

                <h3>How is iframe used?</h3>
                <p>The most common use of an iframe is to load content from another site within the page. The child site
                    can load its own content and cookies, so sites may allow it where they don't allow direct hotlinking
                    content. Using an iframe is the accepted way to embed a YouTube video or Google Maps content. The
                    iframe works by creating a new HTML document environment to load the content within.</p>

                <h3>What is src?</h3>
                <p>Now when you’re embedding a video or the map you will also notice that there is a src attribute
                    that’s then followed by a link. The src is an attribute that specifies the location (URL) of the
                    external resource. It’s an important part of the embedding code.<br><br>See images below for better
                    understanding.
