I first learned about creating a basic HTML page in VS Code. I added a title and 1-2 paragraphs. 

I then learned and added some html, images and links.

Next I created and setup a github and netlify account.

Next I created my style.css file where I formatted my page and add my color scheme. 

Next I used @media to help make the page responsive.

Then I embedded a 20 second video that I created. 

Then I added a contact info web form.

I then added a navigation bar at the top of the page.
