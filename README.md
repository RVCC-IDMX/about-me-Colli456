I first learned about creating a basic HTML page in VS Code. I added a title and 1-2 paragraphs. 

I then learned and added some html, images, and links.

Next, I created and set up a GitHub and Netlify account.

Next, I created my style.css file where I formatted my page and added my color scheme.

I used the #C861E1 color for the background color and the #4C0C5C color for the text in the body and background of images.

Next, I used @media to help make the page responsive.

Then I embedded a 20 second video that I created. 

Then I added a contact info web form.

I then added a navigation bar at the top of the page. 

Next, I created a logo using Microsoft publisher.

For my blog I talked about embedding media into a website page. I go over some of the important parts in the code. 

I then used some examples from the code I used from the embedded map to give the reader a visual example.

Then I displayed the embedded map of Raritan Vally Community College
